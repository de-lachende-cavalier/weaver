# weaver

weaver is a project exploring the possiblity of creating stories automatically, by using an entirely artificial LLM-based end-to-end pipeline[^1].

The human enters the loop in the beginning, specifying the initial conditions, and then the rest is _weaved_ together in an automated fashion.

## Running the code

The code uses `python 3.13.3`.

[^1]: quite the mouthful, I know...
