Moonlight pooled like liquid pearl across the lily-crusted pond at the heart of the old floodplain.  
On a raft of lashed reeds, three contestants waited: a frog in a slipping petal-collar, a bat hanging upside-down like a folded fan, a snake coiled into shifting halos of lantern-light.  
From the far bank the ancient heron—judge and time-keeper—struck his wing against a dead cedar; the sound was a stick dragged across iron.  
“Beauty tonight,” he decreed, “belongs to the creature who can tell why it believes itself beautiful.”  

A hush answered, so complete that even the crickets forgot their own songs.  
Otter, drifting at the pond’s lip, lowered her whiskers to the surface and whispered, “Then sing it—one bar of the lost tune—so we can remember too.”  

The frog’s throat sac ballooned once, twice, drinking moonlight.  
“I am beautiful,” he said, voice soft as moss, “because I remember the world before it forgot how to sing.”  

While the words still hovered, a single cedar drip struck the pool; the ripples raced outward, kissed Otter’s chin, and in that tremor she felt the hush of a mink’s paw pressing mud three body-lengths away.  

She sank without splash or breath, a shadow folding into its own reflection.  
Above, the mink’s whiskers broke the silver seam and found only moonlight where otter had been.  

Below, in root-cathedral darkness, Otter let a silver bead of breath leak from her nostrils—breadcrumb, invitation, dare.  
Mink followed, body turning liquid mercury, every vertebrae unlocking as he became a living arrow notched against the moon’s bow.  

They met in a cloud of silt, belly to belly, nose to nose.  
Neither struck, neither fled; twin heartbeats drummed through shared bone, setting tempo for whatever myth would crawl out of this dark alive.  

Between their pressed chests the frantic bead of mercury settled into a miniature moon—perfect, listening, memorizing the coupled rhythm as if it would later be required to sing it back.  

Above, the lake inhaled; moonlight dripped through in pale needles, and the water cooled, reminding every creature which direction was dawn.  
For the first time since the chase began, neither dreamed of teeth or escape; each dreamed the other’s dream.  

But dawn was still only a rumor carried by cold currents, and the pond had older debts to collect.  

A dome of liquid moonlight now balanced on the surface where Otter’s fingertips had lately touched it.  
Inside the dome her reflection lifted a hand in delayed unison; the warm velvet of the water peeled from her real skin like a glove, leaving her fingers dry.  

The lake sealed over her foot without wetting it—silk tightening into a moon-cold glove.  
The twin’s features, wearing Otter’s face like a dress two sizes too large, rippled into perfect mimicry.  
One more step and their foreheads would touch, yet Otter felt no breath—only the faint tug of a silver thread jerking her veins toward the mirrored sternum.  

Across the clearing, Lynx let fall a braided cord.  
The free end slithered toward the water, tasting for the vanished twin.  
The night heron cracked open slate wings: “Offer or be claimed—river swallows, moon remembers.”  

Otter’s knees buckled; memories surged—lullabies, wet wool, the sour smell of cradle.  
She clutched her wrist, but the bead of moon-light had already soaked in, braiding itself beneath the skin.  

Inside the rising dome, the twin’s pupil dilated until the iris was a thin silver ring—an eclipse that had forgotten how to end.  
A crack forked across the bead; from it seeped the rank breath of low-tide river, the same air that had hung between them the night the twin vanished.  

The bead flashed, slipped Otter’s slick grip, and kissed the surface with a sound no louder than a heartbeat.  
At once the ghost-cord unfurled—wet mirror of the one Lynx had let fall—hovering between the two children, waiting for a hand to claim it.  

Otter did not jerk away.  
She closed her fist, trapping the cord against her pulse.  
“Take the weight,” she whispered to the starlight, “but remember who holds the other end.”  

The cord slackened the width of a heartbeat, tasting her courage and finding it… almost enough.  
Far below, something ancient tugged once, twice, deciding whether to climb or to swallow the line whole.  

On the raft, the frog’s last note lingered like a question.  
The bat unfolded wings of velvet dusk.  
The snake, scales shimmering oil-on-water, waited to speak.  

Above them the heron watched, arrow nocked but bow unstrung, while two silhouettes—otter and mink, hunter and hunted, sister and twin—remained inked upon the same breath, neither finished with the other, neither willing to let the lake decide.  

And so the moon kept its reflection, the river kept its swallowed songs, and the night kept its story—unfinished, braided, waiting for the next ripple to decide which heartbeat would remember and which would forget.
