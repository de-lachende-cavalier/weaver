The last time Abel and Bob spoke, the autumn wind was stripping the maples along River Street, and their breath came out in twin white flags—one furious, one stunned—before Bob turned his collar up and walked backward out of the friendship the way you’d ease away from a dog you suddenly realize is rabid.

Snow is falling now, soft and steady, erasing the footprints Bob left that day.  
Abel stands alone at the same curb, gloved fingers tightening around the cold iron of the bench rail, watching the river move black and slow under the bridge.  
A single red maple leaf—last of the season—spirals down and lands on the back of his hand; he doesn’t brush it away.

The leaf clings like a small scarlet apology, and Abel feels the weight of every word he never said pressing against his ribs.  
He realizes Bob’s footprints weren’t the only things the snow is erasing; the whole argument—those final, irreversible sentences—is being buried too, leaving only the shape of absence.  
Somewhere under the bridge a low horn sounds, the same barge that used to carry their summer laughter downstream, and Abel understands that the river keeps moving even when memory can’t.

Abel folds the leaf between his fingers, crushing it just enough that a bead of moisture—snow or his own thawing grief—travels the crease and falls.  

He steps into the untouched white where Bob’s tracks disappear, planting his boot dead-center so the print swallows the last dimple of Bob’s heel.  

“Not yet,” he whispers, meaning *I’m not ready to let the river take everything.*

The crust of snow gives one brittle complaint and then accepts the print, edges collapsing inward until the boot’s sole is half-buried like a secret too heavy to carry.  
Across the river, the barge lantern swings, a slow pendulum counting nothing, and its wake slaps the pilings—each wet clap a syllable the water keeps stealing from the dead.

Abel’s knuckles whiten as the leaf folds, the red blade surrendering between his thumb and forefinger; he watches the bead slip off like a final syllable Bob never got to speak.  

When he sets his boot down—deliberate, almost tender—he can feel the old track sigh beneath the new, as if the snow itself is complicit in this quiet revision of history.  

The barge horn rolls under the bridge again, deeper than any voice they ever traded, and Abel thinks the sound is the river’s way of reminding him that absences, once shaped, float on forever.

He lets the cold settle into his ribs until it feels like another set of bones.  
Only then does he exhale, slow, willing the cloud of his breath to drift across the channel and snag on the barge’s fading stern—an anchor, a question, a curse.

The snow keeps whatever name he almost whispered, sealing it under a thin glass that will harden tonight to a shell no spring will fully lift.  

Across the water the lantern snuffs—one deliberate breath from the dark—and the barge becomes a black seam stitched between starlight and ice, carrying its unmarked cargo farther than footprints can follow.

He stands alone on the frozen bank, coat open to the wind, letting the river’s cold slip past flesh and muscle until it nests against his ribs like a second skeleton—brittle, unbreakable, and utterly his own.

The river exhales a shard of ice that taps the toe of his boot; he does not flinch.  
Across the water, the drowned treeline shivers, and a single black needle of pine detaches, drifting toward him like a slow accusation.

The shard that kissed his boot was the river’s first word in a language he has learned by heart—cold that does not bite, but remembers.  
He watches the pine needle approach, a sliver of night detached from its own past, and understands it is not accusation but invitation: the river returning to him the one thing he dropped here a year ago, when the ice last spoke and she did not come back up.

He lowers himself slowly, the chill of the water seeping through the denim like a memory seeping through skin. The surface trembles where the pine needle floats, a dark hyphen joining what happened to what might still be said. He speaks her name once—softly, as if the river itself were cupping its hand to its ear—and the syllable tastes like rusted breath held too long inside his chest.

I kneel, because the water is only ankle-deep and the pine needle has landed on the surface like a tiny black bridge.  
I do not touch it yet; I speak her name instead, the one I have not said aloud since the river closed over her red scarf.
