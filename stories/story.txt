Moonlight dripped like liquid silver over the marble balconies of the Sapphire Palace, and every mirror in every hall reflected the same face—alabaster skin, midsummer-sky eyes, lips a single brush-stroke of rose. Court poets had exhausted kingdoms of adjectives on Prince Rowan’s nineteenth birthday, while lantern-portraits of him drifted above the city like paper constellations. Yet the celebrated boy stood alone at the highest window, whispering to the night, “I want to be rid of it,” the words trembling like trapped moths.

The mirrors answered.

Their glass sighed, frost-flowers of fracture racing across each surface. Every reflection of Rowan shuffled aside—baker’s boy, scarred soldier, frost-eyed woman—then vanished, leaving only a silhouette of spilled moonlight wearing his proportions like an empty costume. It stepped from the tallest mirror, bowed with courtly grace, and offered a hand that was smooth, unlined, unbloodied.

Rowan clamped the tremor at the hinge of his wrist, denying the counterfeit right of possession. He flipped the hollow prince’s hand palm-down and pressed his own blood-slick knuckles against the glass breast where a heart should drum—testing whether moonlight can bruise, whether a counterfeit can burn. Warmth bled through the fracture: his warmth, still human, still unceded.

The prince’s chest folded inward like silk drawn through a ring. Inside, moonlight pooled into the shape of a throat that had never swallowed a lie, and from it rose a single note—Rowan’s own voice, aged and echoing: “You kept the line.”

The note slipped past skin and sinew and nestled against the lattice of his ribs, quivering once before it stilled. Rowan felt the hush of silk becoming tunnel, becoming throat; then, barefoot sovereign of no court but this moment, he parted the moon-bleached drapery that hung like a guillotine between worlds. His palm found the prince’s chest at the precise hollow where flesh yields to fold, where skin remembers the shape of a vanished door.

The princely heart answered—thum… thum—a cadence older than either crown stitched into their bloodlines. Inside the rib-glow, the stolen note multiplied, letters begetting letters until the ivory vault was parchment-lanterned with living ink. A hush of heat rose through the flagstones, carrying the afternoon sun hoarded in the stone’s dark belly; it pooled behind Rowan’s eyes like the memory of midsummer. For one held breath both men were barefoot children again—one in a palace orchard, the other in a ditch-side thicket—each tasting the same stolen peach.

Rowan’s hand rested along the parted sternum as though the seam were a mouth learning to speak his name. Ink-warm letters rose to meet his skin, each glyph a heartbeat translated into touch. “Show me the peach again,” he whispered—not asking for fruit but for the moment when two hungry children had shared the same sun. A single bead of peach-coloured light unthreaded from the vaulted page, drifted like a moth, and settled on his tongue—summer flooding every winter he had ever lived.

In that mirrored chapel of light he understood: the door he sought was never locked against him; it had merely waited for his pulse to match the prince’s—two keys turned at last in the same tumbling instant. Outside, the city lanterns reignited, and the mirrors, healed smooth, reflected no one at all.
